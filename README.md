# vue-bootstrap
A tiny wrapper to ease the use of Bootstrap 3 on Vue-based apps

---

> This work is heavily inspired by [VueBoot](https://github.com/Morgul/vueboot), an awesome bleeding edge library capable of handling Bootstrap 4!

## The intent

I love Vue.js, it's an awesome piece of software for the front-end, and I really wanted to leverage it in order to make Bootstrap (another awesome project) easier to use inside a Vue-based application. Just like VueBoot, this is **NOT** meant to replace every bit of bootstrap code and create a magical 100% native product, but actually use Bootstrap as a base to create cool components. 

### VueBoot is out there, why this then?

It's simple: VueBoot works on Bootstrap 4 which, at the moment, is too unstable for most production projects. **vue-bootstrap** on the other hand takes advantage of the latest Bootstrap Stable Release (v3.3.6 as of this writing) and integrates with bootstrap as a plugin, not simply as a collection of components. 

## Installation

- **NPM**: npm install --save vue-bootstrap
- **bower**: bower install --save vue-bootstrap

> NOTE: This project depends on vue and bootstrap, so make sure you have them handy

## Usage

> TODO: Add usage notes

## Development

**vue-bootstrap** is built with [Brunch](http://brunch.io), which is a dead-simple, awesome software building platform made for web technologies.

To prepare your develpment environment simply do: 

```bash
npm install
```

To create a build of this library you can do: 

```bash
npm build
```
